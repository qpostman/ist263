                I am a sophomore at Syracuse University majoring in Magazine, News & Digital Journalism and Innovation, Society Technology with the hopes of becoming a sports/entertainment journalist with a background in designing and managing their own publication/website. I currently write for the Daily Orange and other publications that focus on all things Syracuse. I love to be active, read, and have a great time with my friends. My favorite movie is Itâ€™s Complicated and my favorite TV show is Kitchen Nightmares.
